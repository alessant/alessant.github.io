Are you a bachelor or master student interested in complex networks? Do you wanna complete your internship in a vibrant group? Well, you're on the right spot. 

`Topics you could work on` <br>
Here's a (not comprehensive) list of some of the topics you could work on, but you are very welcome to propose your own idea.

You can find completely hands-on tasks (if you like coding) as well as some other tasks where you will need to study a little of theory. Don't worry! We'll calibrate the work according to your preferences.

  - Web-based hypergraph repository;
  - Hypergraph visualization framework;
  - Parallel and distributed implementation of hypergraph-specific algorithms in Julia.
- Network/Data science/ML tasks
  - Diffusion phenomena on hypergraphs;
  - Friendship evolution on Steam;
  - Hypergraph neural networks;
  - (Temporal) hypergraph immunization techniques;
  - The effect of group relations in social media on opinion dynamics;
  - Opinion dynamics with LLMs.
