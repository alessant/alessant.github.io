Are you a bachelor or master student interested in complex networks? Do you wanna complete your internship in a vibrant lab? Well, you're on the right spot. 

`Topics you could work on` <br>
Here's a (not comprehensive) list of some of the topics you could work on, but you are very welcome to propose your own idea.

You can find completely hands-on tasks (if you like coding) as well as some other tasks where you will need to study a little of theory. Don't worry! We'll calibrate the work according to your preferences.

- Hands-on tasks
  - Web-based hypergraph repository;
  - Hypergraph visualization framework;
  - Parallel and distributed implementation of hypergraph-specific algorithms in Julia.
- Network science tasks
  - Diffusion phenomena on hypergraphs;
  - Friendship evolution on Steam;
  - Hypergraph embedding techniques;
  - (Temporal) hypergraph immunization techniques.

`Where to find me` <br>
I'm a member of the [ISISLab laboratory](https://www.isislab.it/en/). If you're curious about some of the topics I mentioned or you'd like to propose your own idea, join our [ISISLab Discord community](https://discord.gg/BTt5fUp) and let's organize a little chat.

After that, if you're still convinced you wanna work with me, I will gladly become your tutor. Your official university supervisor will still be professor Vittorio Scarano.
