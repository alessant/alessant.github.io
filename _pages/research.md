I am broadly fascinated by modeling and analyzing complex social phenomena through the lenses of networks and multi-agent systems to effectively discover knowledge and get insights to inform strategic decisions.

Since the beginning of my Ph.D., I am specifically working with hypegraphs to abstract the high-order relationships characterizing real-world phenomena. In particular, I am interested in analyzing and/or developing:
- Diffusion patterns and blocking/immunization techniques when many-to-many relationships come into play (social influence maximization, epidemics);
- Friendship patterns and user behavior evolution in online social networks;
- Hypergraph embedding techniques;
- Hypergraph-specific algorithms and tools (visualization platform, repository).

If you think we may have some common interest, don't hesitate to contact me and have a little chat :)
