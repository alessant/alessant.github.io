Hey you, welcome on my page ðŸ¤“

Currently, I am a PostDoc @ the ISISLab laboratory, led by [Professor Vittorio Scarano](https://docenti.unisa.it/001717/home). Here, I have the opportunity to closely work with [Professor Gennaro Cordasco](https://sites.google.com/site/cordasco/) and [Dr. Carmine Spagnuolo](https://spagnuolocarmine.github.io/). My research interests span from `complex systems`, to `agent-based modeling` and `simulation`, to `online user behavior`. 

In my spare time, I enjoy practicing yoga and any other gym activities, reading, and playing board games.
