  abstract = {Hypergraphs have attracted increasing attention in recent years thanks to their flexibility in naturally modeling a broad range of systems where high-order relationships exist among their interacting parts. This survey reviews the newly born hypergraph representation learning problem, whose goal is to learn a function to project objects—most commonly nodes—of an input hyper-network into a latent space such that both the structural and relational properties of the network can be encoded and preserved. We provide a thorough overview of existing literature and offer a new taxonomy of hypergraph embedding methods by identifying three main families of techniques, i.e., spectral, proximity-preserving, and (deep) neural networks. For each family, we describe its characteristics and our insights in a single yet flexible framework and then discuss the peculiarities of individual methods, as well as their pros and cons. We then review the main tasks, datasets, and settings in which hypergraph embeddings are typically used. We finally identify and discuss open challenges that would inspire further research in this field.},

  abstract = {Today, coding skills are among the most required competencies worldwide, often also for non-computer scientists. Because of this trend, community contribution-based, question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms became prominent for finding the proper solution to all programming issues. Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for technical-related questions for years. Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&A platforms are utilized by their users. In line with previous literature, it emphasized the constant decline of Stack Overflow in favor of more community-friendly platforms, such as Reddit, which has been growing rapidly lately.},

  ABSTRACT = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are one of the most effective and successful methods for analyzing real-world complex systems by investigating how modeling interactions on the individual level (i.e., micro-level) leads to the understanding of emergent phenomena on the system level (i.e., macro-level). ABMs represent an interdisciplinary approach to examining complex systems, and the heterogeneous background of ABM users demands comprehensive, easy-to-use, and efficient environments to develop ABM simulations. Currently, many tools, frameworks, and libraries exist, each with its characteristics and objectives. This article aims to guide newcomers in the jungle of ABM tools toward choosing the right tool for their skills and needs. This work proposes a thorough overview of open-source general-purpose ABM tools and offers a comparison from a two-fold perspective. We first describe an off-the-shelf evaluation by considering each ABM tool&rsquo;s features, ease of use, and efficiency according to its authors. Then, we provide a hands-on evaluation of some ABM tools by judging the effort required in developing and running four ABM models and the obtained performance.},

A challenging problem that arises in this domain is to determine a small subset of nodes S (a target-set) able to spread their influence in the whole network. This problem has been formalized and studied in different ways, and many viable solutions have been found for graphs. These have been applied to study several phenomena in research fields such as social, economic, biological, and physical sciences.",

  abstract = {In epidemiology science, the importance to explore innovative modeling tools for acutely analyzing epidemic diffusion is turning into a big challenge considering the myriad of real-world aspects to capture. Typically, equation-based models, such as SIS and SIR, are used to study the propagation of diseases over a population. Improved approaches also include human-mobility patterns as network information to describe contacts among individuals. However, there still is the need to incorporate in these models information about different types of contagion, geographical information, humans habits, and environmental properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes into account: 1. direct and indirect epidemic contagion pathways to explore the dynamics of the epidemic, 2. the times of possible contagions, and 3. human-mobility patterns. We combine these three features exploiting time-varying hypergraphs, and we embed this model into a design-methodology for agent-based models (ABMs), able to improve the correctness in the epidemic estimations of classical contact-network approaches. We further describe a diffusion algorithm suitable for our design-methodology and adaptable to the peculiarities of any disease spreading policies and/or models. Finally, we tested our methodology by developing an ABM, realizing the SIS epidemic compartmental model, for simulating an epidemic propagation over a population of individuals. We experimented the model using real user-mobility data from the location-based social networkFoursquare, and we demonstrated the high-impact of temporal direct and indirect contagion pathways.}

  abstract = {Real-world complex networks are usually being modeled as graphs. The concept of graphs assumes that the relations within the network are binary (for instance, between pairs of nodes); however, this is not always true for many real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes, paper co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often the case that the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a single (hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers to have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks; hence, they are extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle dependencies in such data structures. Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it possible to perform operations on them, from basic algorithms (such as searching or traversing the network) to computing significant hypergraph measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community detection). In this paper, we present a new software library, SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language and designed for high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation. We also present various approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated into our tool. In order to demonstrate how to exploit the library in practice, we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset and the collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are promising and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight than standard graph-based approaches.}

As a result, hypergraphs are suitable and useful to model many important networks and processes. Typical applications are related to social data analysis and include situations such as exchanging emails with several recipients, reviewing products on social platforms, or analyzing security vulnerabilities of information networks. In many situations, using hypergraphs instead of classical graphs allows us to better capture and analyze dependencies within the network. In this paper, we propose a new library, named SimpleHypergraphs.jl, designed for efficient hypegraph analysis. The library exploits the Julia language flexibility and direct support for distributed computing in order to bring a new quality for simulating and analyzing processes represented as hypergraphs.

Recently, two topics are drawing the attention of researchers: the evolution of online social roles and the question of participation inequality. In this work, we bring these two fields together to study and characterize the behavioral evolution of OSNs users according to the quantity and the typology of their social interactions. We found that online participation on the microblogging platform can be categorized into four different activity levels. Furthermore, we empirically verified that the 90-9-1 rule of thumb about participation inequality is not an accurate representation of reality. Findings from our analysis reveal that lurkers are less than expected: they are not 9 out of 10 as suggested by Nielsen, but 3 out of 4. This represents a significant result that can give new insights on how users relate with social media and how their use is evolving towards a more active interaction with the new generation of consumers.}

This study represents a first attempt to characterize and classify OSNs users according to their level of activity through the use of user profile attributes. We analyzed four case studies from the Twitter platform for a final total of around 721 thousand users, divided into four sub-datasets and examined over a period of at least six months in 2017. Following a data-driven methodology, we found that static, profile-based information - based on the entire lifetime of the users - can help to recognize users influence in Twitter online communities. On the other hand, these profile attributes are not enough to characterize user activity on the microblogging platform.}

This study contributes to our understanding of User Engagement at a behavioural level, through an analysis of a HBO Game of Thrones (GoT) fans' Twitter dataset, collected over a six-month period. This analysis across the GoT universe: literary, screen, and media extensions, found users are most engaged in discussions around the TV show, and predictably most particularly the season premiere and finale, on the day after it is aired using mobile devices to post their status updates. Additionally, an initial hash tag analysis reveals users are engaged in both user generated conversations and in corporate TV network campaigns, while initial semantic analysis of tweets reveals TV locations and GOT characters to be the most tweeted about topics. This characterisation of user behaviours presents opportunities to content developers to maximise and capitalise on this active social interaction in a timely manner, keeping the brand alive and also to mine this user feedback in real time to inform the development of forthcomina content.}

  abstract = {Graph Partitioning is a key challenge problem with application in many scientific and technological fields. The problem is very well studied with a rich literature and is known to be NP-hard. Several heuristic solutions, which follow diverse approaches, have been proposed, they are based on different initial assumptions that make them difficult to compare. An analytical comparison was performed based on an Implementation Challenge [3], however being a multi-objective problem (two opposing goals are for instance load balancing and edge-cut size), the results are difficult to compare and it is hard to foresee what can be the impact of one solution, instead of another, in a real scenario. In this paper we analyze the problem in a real context: the development of a distributed agent-based simulation model on a network field (which for instance can model social interactions).}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
