    abstract = {This study explores the structural properties of the Personality Inventory for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, Brief Form (PID-5-BF) by applying network analysis and com- munity detection as a data-driven alternative to traditional factor models. Traditionally, the PID-5-BF assesses personality traits across five domains—Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism—but has shown notable inconsistencies in item alignment and factorial coherence. To examine these issues, data were collected from 2,766 Italian participants (71.7% female, 28.3% male, Mage = 32.94 years, SD = 13.2). The estimated network revealed a stable structure, supported by robust centrality measures (closeness = 0.59, expected influence = 0.75, strength = 0.75). Community detection identified five empirically coherent clusters—Disinhibition, Demoralization, Detachment and Irritability, Psychosocial Alienation, and Pathological Egocentrism—suggesting an alternative organization of maladaptive traits in this population. To assess generalizability, a second analysis was conducted on a Hungarian sample (N = 355), yielding a five-structure solution with different item compositions. While the network approach emphasizes item-level associations, the specific configurations varied across samples in ways that reflect contextual influences. Nonetheless, this method offers complementary insights to tradi- tional factorial models, highlighting how personality traits may organize differently across populations and supporting the use of network-based approaches in refining dimensional models of personality pathology.}

    abstract = {The global proliferation of social media platforms has transformed political communication, making the study of online interactions between politicians and voters crucial for understanding contemporary political discourse. In this work, we present a methodological framework for modeling and examining the dynamics of political messaging and voter behavior in online social media. We propose a nuanced categorization of voters who changed their political preferences over time (i.e., swing voters) based on their shifting patterns, as well as a characterization of their susceptibility to propaganda messages. Drawing on the case of the 2022 Italian elections on Twitter, our analysis reveals that during election periods, politicians’ popularity increases, accompanied by notable variations in the use of persuasive language techniques, including doubt, loaded language, appeals to values, and slogans. Swing voters demonstrate higher vulnerability to these propaganda techniques compared to non-swing voters, with distinct vulnerability patterns across various types of political shifts. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of social media on political opinion formation, contributing to a deeper understanding of the interplay between digital political communication and online voter behavior in contemporary democracies.}

    abstract = {Hypergraphs have emerged as a powerful tool for representing high-order connections in real-world complex systems. Similar to graphs, local structural patterns in hypergraphs, known as high-order motifs (h-motifs), play a crucial role in network dynamics and serve as fundamental building blocks across various domains. For this reason, predicting h-motifs can be highly beneficial in different fields. In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of such complex high-order dynamics by introducing and formalizing the problem of h-motifs prediction. To address this task, we propose a novel solution that leverages both high-order and pairwise information by combining hypergraph and graph convolutions to capture hyperedges correlation within h-motifs, along with an innovative negative sampling approach designed to generate close-to-positive negative samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we defined several baselines inspired by existing literature on hyperedge prediction methods. Our extensive experimental assessments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all the considered baselines, showcasing its superior performance and robustness in predicting h-motifs.}

Nonetheless, significant obstacles like inadequate technical skills and a lack of awareness hinder their effective utilization. As a result, there is a pressing need for learners to cultivate competencies in data and information literacy, which are integral components of 21st-century skill sets. To foster discussion on initiatives to raise awareness of linked open data and enhance users' capabilities to work with them, we proposed a workshop to introduce Italian high school learners to retrieve information from encyclopedic sources modeled as knowledge graphs. Specifically, the workshop guided the learners through the process of querying the Wikidata endpoint via KGSnap!, a block-based programming interface that allows lay users to build and run queries over a SPARQL endpoint. This article describes the activities of the workshop, delineating its protocol, participants, and outcomes. The results indicate that participants were highly engaged and achieved accurate results in the assigned tasks within a short timeframe, suggesting promising expectations for further initiatives in this domain.}

When the data or number of agents grow or multiple runs are necessary, agent-based simulations are generally computationally costly. Therefore, adopting different computing paradigms, such as the distributed one, is essential to manage long-running simulations. The main problem with this approach is finding a way to distribute and balance the simulation field so that the agents can move from one machine to another with the least amount of synchronization overhead. Based on our experiences, we present a Rust-based ABM engine capable of distributing models on high-performance computing resources, gaining remarkable speedup against the sequential version.}

Investigation of deep learning for HOIs, thus, has become a valuable agenda for the data mining and machine learning communities. As networks of HOIs are expressed mathematically as hypergraphs, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representation learning on hypergraphs. Given the emerging trend, we present the first survey dedicated to HNNs, with an in-depth and step-by-step guide. Broadly, the present survey overviews HNN architectures, training strategies, and applications. First, we break existing HNNs down into four design components: (i) input features, (ii) input structures, (iii) message-passing schemes, and (iv) training strategies. Second, we examine how HNNs address and learn HOIs with each of their components. Third, we overview the recent applications of HNNs in recommendation, bioinformatics and medical science, time series analysis, and computer vision. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion on limitations and future directions.}

This absence hinders the ability of researchers and practitioners to validate and benchmark their hypergraph algorithms and models effectively. To bridge this gap, we present HypergraphRepository, a web-based data collection aiming to serve as a centralized hub for hypergraph datasets, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within the hypergraph research community.

Although designed to archive deduplicated small files thanks to the use of a Merkle tree as the underlying data structure, querying the SWH dataset presents challenges due to the nature of these structures, which organize content based on hash values rather than any locality principle. The magnitude of the repository, coupled with the resource-intensive nature of the download process, highlights the need for specialized infrastructure and computational resources to effectively handle and study the extensive dataset housed within SWH. Currently, there is a lack of infrastructures specifically tailored for running analytics on the SWH dataset, leaving users to handle these issues manually. To address these challenges, we implemented the SWH-Analytics (SWHA) framework, a development environment that transparently runs custom analytic applications on publicly available software data preserved over time by SWH. Specifically, this work shows how SWHA can be effectively exploited to study usage patterns of free and open-source software licenses, highlighting the need to improve license literacy among developers.},

Over the last decade, the need for more elaborate computing-demanding models gave rise to many frameworks and tools to run ABM simulations. Current state-of-the-art ABM tools either focus on ease of use, performance, or a trade-off between these two elements. Still, efficiency-oriented solutions (required for both large and small-scale simulations) are vulnerable to memory flaws which could invalidate the experiment results. This work aims to merge efficiency, reliability, and safeness under an innovative ABM software framework based on the Rust programming language. Our framework, krABMaga, is an open-source library that offers a high-level environment by exploiting metaprogramming and expandable visualization features. We equipped our library with a dynamic simulation monitoring system and model exploration and optimization capabilities over parallel, distributed, and cloud architectures. After having presented the overall architecture and functionalities of krABMaga, we discuss a performance comparison of our framework against the mostly adopted ABM software and the scalability potential of our simulation engine on a model calibration experiment running over an AWS EC2 virtual cluster machine. All code and examples models are available on GitHub.},

Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&A platforms are utilized by their users.

We provide a thorough overview of existing literature and offer a new taxonomy of hypergraph embedding methods by identifying three main families of techniques, i.e., spectral, proximity-preserving, and (deep) neural networks. For each family, we describe its characteristics and our insights in a single yet flexible framework and then discuss the peculiarities of individual methods, as well as their pros and cons. We then review the main tasks, datasets, and settings in which hypergraph embeddings are typically used.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of initiatives to let K-12 learners familiarise themselves with Open Data. This review encompasses a total of 21 papers that met the inclusion criteria organising them in taxonomies according to the used data format, the adopted approach, and the expected learning outcome. The discussion compares the included initiative and points out challenges that should be overcome to advance the dialogue around Open Data at school.}

Nonetheless, the complexity of orchestrating and managing such devices requires dedicated architectures and tools and hinders the exploitation of this vast processing capacity. Over the last years, the paradigm of (Browser-based) Volunteer Computing emerged as a unique approach to harnessing such computational capabilities, leveraging the idea of voluntarily offering resources. This article proposes VFuse, a groundbreaking architecture to exploit the Browser-based Volunteer Computing paradigm via a ready-to-access volunteer network. VFuse offers a modern multi-language programming environment for developing scientific workflows using WebAssembly technology without requiring the user any local installation or configuration. We equipped our architecture with a secure and transparent rewarding mechanism based on blockchain technology (Ethereum) and distributed P2P file system (IPFS). Further, the use of Non-Fungible Tokens provides a unique, secure, and transparent methodology for recognizing the users’ participation in the network. We developed a prototype of the proposed architecture and four example applications implemented with our system. All code and examples are publicly available on GitHub.}

However, estimating and evaluating their impact on society remains challenging, considering the numerous and closely tied aspects to examine. This article proposes a fine-grain modeling methodology for NPIs, based on high-order relationships between people and environments, mimicking direct and indirect contagion pathways over time. After assessing the ability of each intervention in controlling an epidemic propagation, we devise a multi-objective optimization framework, which, based on the epidemiological data, calculates the NPI combination that should be implemented to minimize the spread of an epidemic as well as the damage due to the intervention. Each intervention is thus evaluated through an agent-based simulation, considering not only the reduction in the fraction of infected but also to what extent its application damages the daily life of the population. We run experiments on three data sets, and the results illustrate how the application of NPIs should be tailored to the specific epidemic situation. They further highlight the critical importance of correctly implementing personal protective (e.g., using face masks) and sanitization measures to slow down a pathogen spreading, especially in crowded places.}

  abstract = {In most games, social connections are an essential part of the gaming experience. Players connect in communities inside or around games and form friendships, which can be translated into other games or even in the real world. Recent research has investigated social phenomena within the player social network of several multiplayer games, yet we still know very little about how these networks are shaped and formed. Specifically, we are unaware of how the game type and its mechanics are related to its community structure and how those structures vary in different games. This paper presents an initial analysis of Steam users and how friendships on Steam are formed around 200 games. We examine the friendship graphs of these 200 games by dividing them into clusters to compare their network properties and their specific characteristics (e.g., genre, game elements, and mechanics). We found how the Steam user-defined tags better characterized the clusters than the game genre, suggesting that how players perceive and use the game also reflects how they connect in the community. Moreover, team-based games are associated with more cohesive and clustered networks than games with a stronger single-player focus, supporting the idea that playing together in teams more likely produces social capital (i.e., Steam friendships).}

  abstract = {This work deals with a generalization of the minimum Target Set Selection (TSS) problem, a key algorithmic question in information diffusion research due to its potential commercial value. Firstly proposed by Kempe et al., the TSS problem is based on a linear threshold diffusion model defined on an input graph with node thresholds, quantifying the hardness to influence each node. The goal is to find the smaller set of items that can influence the whole network according to the diffusion model defined. This study generalizes the TSS problem on networks characterized by many-to-many relationships modeled via hypergraphs. Specifically, we introduce a linear threshold diffusion process on such structures, which evolves as follows. Let H=(V,E) be a hypergraph. At the beginning of the process, the nodes in a given set S⊆V are influenced. Then, at each iteration, (i) the influenced hyperedges set is augmented by all edges having a sufficiently large number of influenced nodes; (ii) consequently, the set of influenced nodes is enlarged by all the nodes having a sufficiently large number of already influenced hyperedges. The process ends when no new nodes can be influenced. Exploiting this diffusion model, we define the minimum Target Set Selection problem on hypergraphs (TSSH). Being the problem NP-hard (as it generalizes the TSS problem), we introduce four heuristics and provide an extensive evaluation on real-world networks.},

  abstract = {In epidemiology science, the importance to explore innovative modeling tools for acutely analyzing epidemic diffusion is turning into a big challenge considering the myriad of real-world aspects to capture. Typically, equation-based models, such as SIS and SIR, are used to study the propagation of diseases over a population. Improved approaches also include human-mobility patterns as network information to describe contacts among individuals. However, there still is the need to incorporate in these models information about different types of contagion, geographical information, humans habits, and environmental properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes into account: 1. direct and indirect epidemic contagion pathways to explore the dynamics of the epidemic, 2. the times of possible contagions, and 3. human-mobility patterns. We combine these three features exploiting time-varying hypergraphs, and we embed this model into a design-methodology for agent-based models (ABMs), able to improve the correctness in the epidemic estimations of classical contact-network approaches. We further describe a diffusion algorithm suitable for our design-methodology and adaptable to the peculiarities of any disease spreading policies and/or models. Finally, we tested our methodology by developing an ABM, realizing the SIS epidemic compartmental model, for simulating an epidemic propagation over a population of individuals. We experimented the model using real user-mobility data from the location-based social networkFoursquare, and we demonstrated the high-impact of temporal direct and indirect contagion pathways.}

  abstract = {Real-world complex networks are usually being modeled as graphs. The concept of graphs assumes that the relations within the network are binary (for instance, between pairs of nodes); however, this is not always true for many real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes, paper co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often the case that the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a single (hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers to have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks; hence, they are extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle dependencies in such data structures. Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it possible to perform operations on them, from basic algorithms (such as searching or traversing the network) to computing significant hypergraph measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community detection). In this paper, we present a new software library, SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language and designed for high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation. We also present various approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated into our tool. In order to demonstrate how to exploit the library in practice, we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset and the collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are promising and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight than standard graph-based approaches.}

As a result, hypergraphs are suitable and useful to model many important networks and processes. Typical applications are related to social data analysis and include situations such as exchanging emails with several recipients, reviewing products on social platforms, or analyzing security vulnerabilities of information networks. In many situations, using hypergraphs instead of classical graphs allows us to better capture and analyze dependencies within the network. In this paper, we propose a new library, named SimpleHypergraphs.jl, designed for efficient hypegraph analysis. The library exploits the Julia language flexibility and direct support for distributed computing in order to bring a new quality for simulating and analyzing processes represented as hypergraphs.

Recently, two topics are drawing the attention of researchers: the evolution of online social roles and the question of participation inequality. In this work, we bring these two fields together to study and characterize the behavioral evolution of OSNs users according to the quantity and the typology of their social interactions. We found that online participation on the microblogging platform can be categorized into four different activity levels. Furthermore, we empirically verified that the 90-9-1 rule of thumb about participation inequality is not an accurate representation of reality. Findings from our analysis reveal that lurkers are less than expected: they are not 9 out of 10 as suggested by Nielsen, but 3 out of 4. This represents a significant result that can give new insights on how users relate with social media and how their use is evolving towards a more active interaction with the new generation of consumers.}

This study represents a first attempt to characterize and classify OSNs users according to their level of activity through the use of user profile attributes. We analyzed four case studies from the Twitter platform for a final total of around 721 thousand users, divided into four sub-datasets and examined over a period of at least six months in 2017. Following a data-driven methodology, we found that static, profile-based information - based on the entire lifetime of the users - can help to recognize users influence in Twitter online communities.

  abstract = {User Engagement in digital experiences is a fundamental concern for technology developers, educators, businesses, TV networks and marketing agencies. However, engagement remains a confusing concept with cognitive, emotional and behavioural dimensions, that depends on a large number of technical and human interrelated factors. This study contributes to our understanding of User Engagement at a behavioural level, through an analysis of a HBO Game of Thrones (GoT) fans' Twitter dataset, collected over a six-month period. This analysis across the GoT universe: literary, screen, and media extensions, found users are most engaged in discussions around the TV show, and predictably most particularly the season premiere and finale, on the day after it is aired using mobile devices to post their status updates. Additionally, an initial hash tag analysis reveals users are engaged in both user generated conversations and in corporate TV network campaigns, while initial semantic analysis of tweets reveals TV locations and GOT characters to be the most tweeted about topics. This characterisation of user behaviours presents opportunities to content developers to maximise and capitalise on this active social interaction in a timely manner, keeping the brand alive and also to mine this user feedback in real time to inform the development of forthcomina content.}

  abstract = {Graph Partitioning is a key challenge problem with application in many scientific and technological fields. The problem is very well studied with a rich literature and is known to be NP-hard. Several heuristic solutions, which follow diverse approaches, have been proposed, they are based on different initial assumptions that make them difficult to compare. An analytical comparison was performed based on an Implementation Challenge [3], however being a multi-objective problem (two opposing goals are for instance load balancing and edge-cut size), the results are difficult to compare and it is hard to foresee what can be the impact of one solution, instead of another, in a real scenario. In this paper we analyze the problem in a real context: the development of a distributed agent-based simulation model on a network field (which for instance can model social interactions).}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
